Cloud-based Big Data Systems Project: Use a major Big Data system to perform a Data Engineering related task

## Big Idea & Plan
I am trying to see if I can replicate the work similar to this: https://huggingface.co/andite/pastel-mix

> I found out this is not too feasible and decide to preprocess dataset using Rust Language. Instead, I decide to do food image classification. Here is the reference of data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/food-101. I will pre-train the model in python and implement in Rust.
